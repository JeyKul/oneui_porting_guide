well this one is hella easy.

On CRB please go to "âœ¨" on the left side

Click on "Build Image"

Hover over "Image Size" number 

hit the 3 dots on the right (if you do not see them, you [havent converted your filesystem](./extrfw.md))

then click the button to calc R/W size

now you will see another size like the other one. write them down and have a realisation that we have to debloat some stuff!
